    "question": "What is supervised learning?",
    "answer": "Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm that is concerned with reproducing a target value as accurately as possible on the basis of a prediction. The training data consists of n independent variables and one or more dependent variables to be predicted. Typically, in the case of a linear function, an intercept is represented. Such a function can be learned and fitted with arbitrary accuracy through supervised learning."
